The Movie DB api (www.themoviedb.org).

===================================================

To start developing you should get and api key at
www.themoviedb.org.

With the key in hands create app/secrets.properties
file. It is a key/value pairs based file and you 
must add keys for Debug and Release versions using
the following entries:

You can use the same key for both entries.
